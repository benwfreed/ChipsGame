The ChipsGame.java file contains the ChipsGame class: a few constructors for creating chips game objects and the methods required for playing the chips game.

The ChipsGameWindow.java file is the entryway into the program. It initializes a chips game object and creates a java swing GUI through which the chips game methods are called.
