#ChipsGame

This program lets the user play a simple take away game. (You can read more about the particular game here: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15859-f01/www/notes/comb.pdf) The user's oppenent implements a strategy that will guarantee her victory unless the user herself makes the correct move during each of her turns.

The ChipsGame.java file contains the ChipsGame class: a few constructors for creating chips game objects and the methods required for playing the chips game.

The ChipsGameWindow.java file is the entryway into the program. It initializes a chips game object and creates a java swing GUI through which the chips game methods are called.
